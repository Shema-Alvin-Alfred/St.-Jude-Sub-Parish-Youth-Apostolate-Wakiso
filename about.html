        <h1>ABOUT US</h1>
   <h3>Vision:</h3> <p>Vibrant and financially independent youth community in Wakiso, building a better future for themselves and their families.</p>
    <h3>Our Story:</h3> <p>The Wakiso Youth Apostolate Inititaive was founded in 2017 by a group of passionate young people who recognized the need for a structured way to save money and invest in their future. Inspired by the spirit of community and mutual support, we started with a handful of members and today we are growing, proving that by working together, we can achieve great things.</p>
    <p>We are also skilling the youth who to make craft shoes and this will improve on their standard of living as well as impacting on the society growth since the society is the customer at large.</p>
    <h3>Resource & Financial Literacy</h3>
   <h4>The Share-Out</h4> <p>At the end of our financial cycle, usually after 12 months, the total savings and all accumulated interest are divided and paid out to members based on their individual contributions. This allows members to receive a lump sum for larger investments or projects.</p>
